1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS as explained to me throughout class and from concepts that I've implemented in my assignments is nothing more than another form of a library for JS and is used by programmers to solve problems of developers handling active data for quicker response times. 

1. What does it mean to think in react?

To think in React means to think about the creative process of the apps as you're building out and how they will respond as far as the UI goes. 

1. Describe state.

'State' is an object that allows dynamic and interactive creativity to how components are rendered and behaves. 

1. Describe props.

'Props' are variables passed to a react component by another component (i.e., parent component). 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

'Side effects' are general concepts about behaviors of functions. Modifying anything outside of its body is a 'side effect' of a function. Using an array as the second parameter of 'useEffect' is how you're able to sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes.
